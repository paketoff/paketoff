Hi there! I'm Roman, a Full Stack Software Engineer @ProHacktiv building software across startups, edtech, AI SaaS, and public digital services. I specialize in robust backend systems (Python, FastAPI, microservices) and also deliver polished front-end experiences (Vue, Angular, with a dash of React). I’ve taken products end-to-end — from architecture and code to tests, CI/CD, and cloud deployments.
